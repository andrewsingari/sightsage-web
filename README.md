# SightSage Web (Prototype)

A minimal React + Vite + TypeScript prototype that ports your mobile screens to the web with routing and Tailwind.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Routes
- `/` Home
- `/membership`
- `/products`
- `/education`
- `/login`
- `/consultations`
- `/questionnaire/:topic`

## Notes
- The data is mocked (no backend). Replace with your APIs in `pages/*`.
- Tailwind is preconfigured. Edit `tailwind.config.js` for theme.
```
